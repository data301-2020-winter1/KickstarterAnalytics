## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
We aim to see how analysts analyze soccer teams  based on different factors that contribute to the game. Soccer is a tricky sport to model because there are so few goals scored in each match. The final scoreline will fairly often disagree with many people’s impressions of the quality of each team’s play, and the low-scoring nature of the sport will sometimes lead to prolonged periods of luck, where a team may be getting good results despite playing poorly (or vice versa). Therefore, the analysis, which is updated monthly provides information, on how team's overall performance affect their overall ranking estimating each team's underlying quality of performance. Factoring in things like league strength also, the data provides insight into learning about future scores, as the SPI (Soccer Power Index) is used by oddsmakers to figure out betting odds also.

Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform that aims to help business ideas develop through the support of the community. Our dataset aims to analyze the common characteristics that successful crowdfunded startups share. The data was obtained from Kaggle, an online data science community, and it holds information such as  the date a Kickstarter campaign was started, the amount they wished to raise, category of their products, amount they actually raised, currency used, and date the crowdfunding ends.  The time frame the information was collected on started on May of 2009 and finished on March of 2018. The purpose of our dataset, as per its creator, is to foment interest in crowdfunding platforms. The creator presents this data under a creative commons license and incentivizes fellow data scientists to use it for analysis. He even presents examples of possible projects that could be created using the data. The information was obtained directly from the Kickstarter platform by the creator of the dataset.
